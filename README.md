### End to end UAV controller using deep reinforcement learning algorithm

### Structure
All the source code is in folder "hover_rl/end2end"

#### Env
We use [RotorPy](https://github.com/spencerfolk/rotorpy), a Python-based multirotor simulation environment with aerodynamic wrenches, useful for education and research in estimation, planning, and control for UAVs.

#### To run the training:
```
python3 train.py
```

#### To run the testing:
```
python3 test.py
```
